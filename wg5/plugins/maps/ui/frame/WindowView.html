        It is possible to limit the type of a value-based element. However,
        for this we must introduce two new terms: the element class type and the element instance type.

        Given &lt;Expr /&gt;, the element class type is the type of Expr. So in the example above,
        if MyComponent was an ES6 class the class type would be that class.
        If MyComponent was a factory function, the class type would be that function.

        Once the class type is established, the instance type is determined by
        the union of the return types of the class type’s call signatures and construct signatures.
        So again, in the case of an ES6 class, the instance type would be the type of an
        instance of that class, and in the case of a factory function, it would be the type
        of the value returned from the function.
